This project originates from my Master's thesis at the University of Hamburg, focusing on Mathematical Modeling in Engineering.

The model relies on a statistical approach involving generative methods, with a primary assumption of a Gaussian distribution. Although various statistical methods are available, the model has been implemented with a preference for Gaussian distribution.

The code is written in Python, utilizing the PyTorch library for efficient management of tensor elements. Due to computational and time constraints, the training set was limited to 10,000 distinct triangles.

After extensive training and parameter adjustments, the code demonstrates the ability to accurately reproduce new triangles.
